<p>A core objective of the Columbia University Libraries is to make our archival collections accessible for research and scholarship. However, certain digital items cannot be published online due to copyright restrictions or privacy and confidentiality concerns.</p>
<p>These materials can only be viewed in the Burke's Special Collections Reading Room during its hours of operation (M-F, 10-4:30).</p>
<p>Requests for obtaining copies of these materials are subject to approval by designated staff members. Please see the <a href="https://library.columbia.edu/libraries/burke.html">Burke Library's homepage</a> for more information on planning your visit.</p>
