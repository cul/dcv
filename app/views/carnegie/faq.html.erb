	<hr>


		<h3 class="h4">Is the entire archival collection for the Carnegie Corporation of New York now available online?</h3>
		<p>No. The website includes content that was digitized due to preservation concerns (such as Andrew Carnegie grant files and financial record books), the full run of the Carnegie Corporation’s annual reports,&nbsp;correspondence pertaining to Gunnar Myrdal’s “American Dilemma” study, selected digitized audiovisual public relations materials, and oral histories. It will eventually include born-digital records of late 20th/early 21st century. The majority of the Corporation’s archival files still exist on paper only.</p>
		<h3 class="h4">How do I access materials that are not available digitally?</h3>
		<p>An up to date finding aid to the complete Carnegie Corporation of New York archive can be found here [insert link<a href="#cmnt1">[a]</a>]. To consult these materials you will need to visit the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://library.columbia.edu/locations/rbml.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1548361129072000">Rare Book & Manuscript Library</a>&nbsp;in person. You can request material in advance via the finding aid and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://aeon.cul.columbia.edu/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1548361129073000">register with us by visiting here</a>.</p>
		<p>For oral history interviews that are unavailable digitally, please visit the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://library.columbia.edu/locations/ccoh/FAQ.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1548361129074000">Oral History Archives at Columbia website</a>&nbsp;for details on reading transcripts or listening to audio in the Rare Book & Manuscript reading room.</p>
		<p>Please note that not all of the oral history media and transcripts have been synchronized.</p>
		<h3 class="h4">Why can’t I find current Carnegie Corporation of New York records?</h3>
		<p>Columbia University is the repository of record for the Corporation’s archive. Like most 21st century organizations, the Corporation’s records now take “born” digital form. Eventually, this platform will serve as an access point for both the digitized records of the past and the born digital records of the future. However, the majority of the Corporation’s records are subject to a 15 year embargo from the time of creation. We expect that the first born digital records will be available by 2030.</p>
		<h3 class="h4">Why are some files, such as Library and Church Organ donations are of such poor quality?</h3>
		<p>The Corporation microfilmed the correspondence files relating to Andrew Carnegie's gifts and grants in the late 1940s and subsequently discarded the original documents. &nbsp;Archival microfilming at that time was in its very early stage of development, so very few quality control procedures were in place; the resulting microfilms were black and white 16mm reels. As part of the Carnegie Digital Past and Future project, these aging microfilms were digitized and are now available for you online. The quality of the resulting digital images corresponds to the quality of the microfilm originals. An exception to this rule were the New York Public Library (NYPL) records, which were donated to that institution and maintained. As a result, the NYPL Library file is the only one digitized from original paper records, so the images are in color and of much higher quality.</p>

		<h3 class="h4">Does Columbia hold other Carnegie-related archives?</h3>
