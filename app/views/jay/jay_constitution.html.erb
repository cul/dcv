      <h4 align="">SUPPORTING A STRENGTHENED
        CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE</h4>
      <p class="justified12px">Jay's correspondence and public papers as Secretary
        for Foreign Affairs reflected his concern about the
        impotence of the Confederation government to shape
        foreign policy and the need for a central government
        that could act with energy and authority. As he observed
        to Thomas Jefferson in the summer of 1786, "Until our
        Affairs shall be more perfectly arranged, we shall
        treat under Disadvantages, and therefore I am not surprised
        that our Negociations with Britain and Barbary are
        unpromising. To be respectable abroad it is necessary
        to be so at Home, and that will not be the Case until
        our public Faith acquires more Confidence, and our
        Government more strength." [<em>Jay to Jefferson, July
        14, 1786,</em> <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.05856" target="_blank" class="">5856</a>; <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.02465" target="_blank" class="">2465</a>]
      </p><p class="justified12px">Nevertheless Jay was hopeful that constructive results
        would ensue from seemingly negative circumstances.
        To Lafayette he adopted a cheerful tone in reporting
        the growing resentment among American merchants of
        European restraints on American trade: "Good will
        come out of evil; these discontents nourish federal
        ideas," Jay
        remarked.[<em>Jay to Lafayette, July 15, 1785, </em>&nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.05742" target="_blank" class="">5742</a>, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.02416" target="_blank" class="">2416</a>] &nbsp;Even
        the Algerine episode was viewed optimistically. That
        conflict, he wrote President of Congress Richard Henry
        Lee, "does not strike me as a great evil. The
        more we are ill-treated abroad the more we shall unite
        and consolidate at home." Jay, as a strong advocate
        of preparedness, conceived of a war with the Barbary
        pirates as providing "a nursery for seamen" and
        laying "the
        foundation for a respectable Navy." [<em>Jay to
        the President of Congress (Richard Henry Lee),</em> October
        13, 1785, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.00157" target="_blank" class="">157</a>, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.05152" target="_blank" class="">5152</a>]
      </p><p class="justified12px">Jay's conviction about the need for a stronger union
        was bolstered not only by the weak posture of America
        in foreign affairs but by the instability and impotence
        he saw at home--paper money agitation, boundary conflicts
        between the states, the failure of the states to expunge
        from their books laws preventing full compliance with
        the treaty with Great Britain, and the chronic problem
        of raising adequate federal revenue by requisition.
        A sense of political malaise was transformed into a
        recognition of crisis by the outbreak of Shays' Rebellion
        in the late summer and fall of '86. What were needed
        were "federal measures," Jay reiterated in letters
        to his correspondents. [<em>Jay to Jefferson, August
        13, 1785,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.02422" target="_blank" class="">2422</a>, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.05753" target="_blank" class="">5753</a>]
      </p><p class="justified12px">The rebellion in Massachusetts aroused Jay, as it
        did Geroge Washington. "Justice must have a sword
        as well as a balance," he commented to Edward
        Rutledge, [December 12, 1786, &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.11244" target="_blank" class="">11244</a> (no
        image)] while on the very same day he addressed a lengthier
        letter to Jacob Read, lamenting the price that had
        to be paid to bring order out of confusion, "especially
        when a little virtue and good sense would procure it
        for us on very reasonable Terms." [December 12,
        1786, &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.12783" target="_blank" class="">12783</a>, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.11966" target="_blank" class="">11966</a> (no
        image)] &nbsp;Three weeks later, he informed William
        Carmichael that, although the "Commotion" in
        Massachusetts had not yet subsided, the "Government
        has manifested great Moderation, and condescended to
        hear the Complaints of the malcontents with much Respect." The
        issue of the disturbances was still "far from
        certain," he
        noted, while the "Inefficiency of the federal
        Government" became
        increasingly manifest. To amend the system of government
        now engaged the "serious attention of the best
        people in all the States....Perhaps in a few months
        we will have a clearer picture of the prospects for
        a Convention," Jay
        added.[January 4, 1787,&nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.07725" target="_blank" class="">7725</a> (no
        image)].
      </p><p class="justified12px">A sense of crisis and a burgeoning nationalism combined
        to shape Jay's constitutional thinking in the months
        before the convening of the federal convention. With
        Gouverneur Morris he had concurred in the view that
        a "national spirit is the natural result of national
        existence."[<em>January 10, 1784,</em>&nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.11392" target="_blank" class="">11392</a>]&nbsp; To
        Lord Lansdowne Jay averred that "I cannot persuade
        myself that Providence has created such a nation, in
        such a country, to remain like dust in the balance
        of others."[<em>16 April, 1786,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.08172" target="_blank" class="">8172</a>, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.04070" target="_blank" class="">4070</a>]
      </p><p class="justified12px">Jay believed that through constitutional reformation
        America's standing in the world could be enhanced.
        First of all, he held advanced views on centralization
        and the subordination of the states, views shared by
        Alexander Hamilton, perhaps alone among the Founding
        Fathers. In 1785 he wrote John Lowell: "It is my first
        wish to see the United States assume and merit the
        character of one great nation, whose territory is divided
        into different States merely for more convenient government
        and the more easy and prompt administration of justice,
        just as our several States are divided into counties
        and townships for the like purpose." [<em>May 10, 1785,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.05726" target="_blank" class="">5726</a>, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.01642" target="_blank" class="">1642</a>]&nbsp; The
        following year he expressed to Adams his gratification
        over the recent marriages of Elbridge Gerry and Rufus
        King to women from states other than their own. These "intermarriages," as
        he called them, "tend to assimilate the States, and
        to promote one of the first wishes of my heart, viz.,
        to see the people of America become one nation in every
        respect; for, as to the separate [state] legislatures,
        I would have them considered, with relation to the
        Confederacy, in the same light in which counties stand
        to the State of which they are parts, viz., merely
        as districts to facilitate the purposes of domestic
        order and good government." [<em>Jay to Adams, May
        4, 1786,</em> , <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.07461" target="_blank" class="">7461</a>]
        Jay, in recognizing the depth of particularist tendencies,
        was more discreet than Hamilton about publicizing his
        views, and usually confined them to private correspondence.
        Nevertheless, his centralizing views would be evident
        in his later Supreme Court decisions, notably in <em>Chisholm</em> <em>v</em>. <em>Georgia</em>.
      </p><p class="justified12px">Secondly, although Jay had been one of the earliest
        and most consistent advocates of augmenting the powers
        of Congress in the areas of taxation and the regulation
        of commerce, he was concerned that an omnipotent Congress
        might be established. To prevent such a possibility
        he advocated the separation of powers and checks and
        balances. "I have long sought," he wrote Jefferson
        in 1786, "and become daily more convinced that the
        construction of our Federal government is fundamentally
        wrong. To vest legislative, judicial, and executive
        powers in one and the same body of men, and that, too,
        in a body daily changing its members, can never be
        wise. In my opinion, these three great departments
        of sovereignty should be forever separated, and so
        distributed as to serve as checks on each other."[<em>August
        18, 1786,</em> , <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.05860" target="_blank" class="">5860</a>]&nbsp; Again: "Let
        Congress legislate," he wrote Washington in 1787. "Let
        others execute. Let others judge." To the executive
        he would give a veto power over the acts passed by
        a dual-chambered legislature. [<em>January 7,1787,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.08424" target="_blank" class="">8424</a>, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.10393" target="_blank" class="">10393</a> (no
        images)]
      </p><p class="justified12px">Thirdly, while Jay advocated a strong executive, he
        was not prepared to settle for a king "while other
        experiments remain untried." This commitment to republicanism
        was consistent with his support for popular sovereignty,
        which at this time manifested itself in his advocacy
        of a true constituent or plenipotentiary convention
        to be chosen by the people through state conventions
        and not by the state legislatures. Referring to the
        proposed Annapolis Convention, Jay advised Washington, "no
        alterations in the government should, I think, be made,
        nor if attempted will easily take place unless from
        the only source of just authority--the People." &nbsp; If
        the Philadelphia convention did not pursue the procedural
        steps he outlined in this letter, the means adopted
        for ratifying the Constitution reflected his own principles
        about the locus of sovereignty [<em>January 7, 1787,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.08424" target="_blank" class="">8424</a>, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.10393" target="_blank" class="">10393</a> (no
        images) ].
      </p><p class="justified12px">Finally, the supremacy clause of the Constitution
        drew its authority from the circular letter to the
        states adopted by Congress in April 1787 as drafted
        by Jay. In that resolution the point was made that
        a treaty "constitutionally made, ratified and published" by
        Congress was "immediately binding on the whole nation" and
        superseded the laws of the land. No state could abridge
        its obligations.[<em>Jay's draft, April 6, 1787,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.03968" target="_blank" class="">3968</a>, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.04593" target="_blank" class="">4593</a>]</p>

      <h4 align="">JOHN JAY AND THE
        PHILADELPHIA CONVENTION (1787) </h4>
      <p class="justified12px">Although not in attendance at the meeting convened
        at Annapolis in September 1786 for the ostensible purpose
        of resolving interstate commercial disputes, Jay anticipated
        by almost a month the address to the states drafted
        by Alexander Hamilton and adopted on 14 September.&nbsp; That
        address called upon all the states to send commissioners
        to a new convention at Philadelphia in May 1787 to
        discuss not only commercial problems but <em>all</em> matters
        necessary "to render the constitution of the Federal
        Government adequate to the exigencies of the Union." Meantime,
        as early as March of that year Jay had expressed support
        for a constitutional convention with much broader objectives.
        [<em>Jay to Washington, March 16, 1786,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.08420" target="_blank" class="">8420</a>, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.10391" target="_blank" class="">10391</a> (no
        image)]. More specifically, he spelled out in a letter
        of 18 August to Jefferson his strong views on the need
        for reconstructing the federal government [&nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.05860" target="_blank" class="">5860</a>].&nbsp; "The
        people," Jay reported later in the winter to Lafayette, "were
        divided in sentiment respecting the expediency" of
        such a course [<em>February 16, 1787,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.05886" target="_blank" class="">5886</a>, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.02493" target="_blank" class="">2493</a>],
        and he was even doubtful that anything constructive
        would ensue. At best, Jay conceded, "no evil" was "to
        be apprehended" from such a meeting, and in the longer
        run, "much good."
      </p><p class="justified12px">Jay was undoubtedly the most influential proponent
        of constitutional reform who was denied an opportunity
        to attend the Philadelphia convention. Adams later
        said that Jay was "of more importance than any of the
        rest, indeed of almost as much weight as all the rest." &nbsp; Adams
        himself and Jefferson, two of the other principal absentee
        Founders, were serving abroad at the time and unavailable,
        but Jay who was on hand and ready and willing was ignored.
        His name was not even placed in nomination either in
        the New York State Senate or the General Assembly. &nbsp;When
        Hamilton, who had been selected, attempted to expand
        the New York delegation from three to five and urged
        Jay's appointment, his motion was defeated.&nbsp; Despite
        his strong Federalist proclivities, Hamilton was acceptable
        to the legislature, even to the antifederalist Assembly,
        because of the general feeling that some constitutional
        reform was needed, and New York ought to send the author
        of the Annapolis report to Philadelphia. But one such
        delegate was thought to be enough. To check Hamilton's
        possible extremism, and to provide balance to the delegation,
        the legislature also chose Robert Yates and John Lansing,
        men of moderate views not yet clearly identified either
        with federalism or antifederalism, who could, if necessary,
        form a majority against their brilliant colleague.
      </p><p class="justified12px">While Jay was not a delegate and the Convention's
        deliberations were secret, there is some evidence suggesting
        that Jay was not inhibited from attempting to publicize
        his views among certain delegates. Prior to the convening
        of the Philadelphia meeting, as we have seen, Jay advanced
        some of the notions embodied in the Randolph Plan,
        including enlarged powers for Congress and the President,
        separation of powers, and checks and balances. On 25
        July 1787 he addressed a letter to George Washington,
        the Convention's presiding officer, advancing the view
        that the Chief Executive should be a "natural born
        citizen," a suggestion to be embodied in Article II,
        Section 1, Clause 5 of the Constitution. [&nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.10627" target="_blank" class="">10627</a>, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.12782" target="_blank" class="">12782</a>]
      </p><p class="justified12px">Some three weeks later he drafted a petition for the
        New York Manumission Society calling upon the Convention
        to give consideration to the manumission of slaves
        and the protection of freed blacks, but evidently on
        the advice of Hamilton, on leave from the Convention,
        he and his fellow members abstained from formally petitioning
        Congress.
      </p><p class="justified12px">While Jay complained that the protracted meeting in
        Philadelphia made it impossible to muster a quorum
        of nine states in Congress, essential to any action
        being taken on foreign affairs matters, [<em>Jay to
        John Adams, July 4, 1787,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.02503" target="_blank" class="">2503</a>, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.07463" target="_blank" class="">7463</a>] &nbsp;he
        approved the secrecy of the Convention's proceedings
        and believed that the longer the Convention lasted
        the likelier it would be productive of substantial
        changes in the federal structure. Once his father-in-law
        William Livingston went to the Convention as a New
        Jersey delegate in July, replacing William Paterson,
        who was obliged to return home, Jay began to receive
        communications which, while revealing nothing of substance,
        took on an optimistic tone. Despite his reservations
        about untramelled democracy, Jay had faith in the wisdom
        of the people and believed that, in the end, they would
        approve the Convention's results. As he wrote Jefferson
        on 8 September, "there is...a degree of intelligence
        and information in the mass of our people which affords
        much room for hope that by degrees our affairs will
        assume a more consistent and pleasant aspect." [<em>Jay
        to Jefferson, September 8, 1787,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.02514" target="_blank" class="">2514</a>, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.05907" target="_blank" class="">5907</a>]<br>

      </p><h4 align="">THE FEDERALIST (1787-1788)</h4>
      <h4 align=""> The Great Collaboration</h4>
      <p class="justified12px"> To refute the numerous articles critical of the Constitution
        which New York newspapers were carrying in the last
        week of September and the first week of October 1787
        Hamilton conceived the idea of <em>The Federalist</em>.
        Initially Hamilton turned to Jay and William Duer as
        collaborators, and Jay responded at once, writing letters
        Nos. 2 through 5, while Duer's pieces were never used.
        Gouverneur Morris, though "warmly pressed," declined
        an invitation to participate. Turning out copy at breakneck
        pace, Jay had his initial letter, No. 2, published
        in the <em>New York Independent Journal</em> on 31
        October, No. 3 on 3 November, No. 4 on 7 November,
        and the fifth letter three days later. Either before
        he left New York around the middle of November, perhaps
        on the 17th, or upon his return to the city from a
        trip to Philadelphia, James Madison was invited by
        Hamilton to join the enterprise. This was fortunate
        for both content and continuity, for between 10 November,
        when the fifth <em>Federalist</em> letter appeared,
        and some weeks prior to 7 March 1788, the date of publication
        of Jay's No. 64, the next and last contribution of
        Jay to that great seminal work, Jay suffered a serious
        bout of ill health. He seems to have been painfully
        crippled by rheumatoid arthritis, although he could
        report by 11 February 1788 that his health was "pretty
        well re-established." </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> Writing not many months after the collaborators had
        completed their contributions to <em>The Federalist</em>,
        Madison sent off a ciphered dispatch to Jefferson,
        naming Jay, Hamilton, and himself as the authors of <em>The
        Federalist</em> and adding some illuminating facts: "The
        proposal came from the two former. The execution was
        thrown by the illness of Jay mostly on the two others.
        Though carried on in concert the writers are not mutually
        answerable for all the ideas of each other, there being
        seldom time for even a perusal of the pieces by any
        but the writer before they were wanted at the press
        and some times hardly by the writer himself." Years
        later Madison volunteered a different version of why
        Jay discontinued his contribution, if we are to believe
        an unidentified source. When the question was put to
        Madison he reportedly replied, "After a few numbers
        had been published, Mr. Jay remarked to him [Madison]
        and Mr. Hamilton, that his [Jay's] style of writing
        was not calculated for the undertaking in which they
        had embarked. It was too mild and placid; and requested
        them to Exonerate him from any further connection with
        the publication. To this they assented."&nbsp; There
        is no corroboration of this second account, and Jay's
        self-attributed sense of literary inadequacy is scarcely
        supported by prior or subsequent polemical writings.
        Jay's own letters in this period document the debilitating
        character of his illness. </p>
      <a name="riot"></a>
      <h4 align="">John Jay and the Doctors Riot</h4>
      <p class="justified12px"> That recovery was seriously jeopardized by the mishap
        that befell him as a participant in the Doctors Riot.
        The riot started on Sunday, 13 April 1788, when as
        a prank a medical student waved a dismembered limb
        at some boys below a window of the New York Hospital.
        The finding of dismembered corpses inside the building
        pointed to grave-robbing, and in the ensuing riot physicians
        and students from the hospital were forced to take
        refuge in the city jail. Hamilton, attempting to stop
        the rioters in front of Columbia College, was swept
        aside. Governor George Clinton and Mayor James Duane
        then sought to restrain the mob from attacking the
        jail, but even a small contingent of militia was chased
        away. By the following afternoon, with the jail still
        under siege, Matthew Clarkson and Jay, armed with their
        swords, marched toward the jail accompanied by some
        fifty militiamen. Jay was struck in the forehead with
        a stone, and others, including Baron von Steuben, similarly
        assaulted. Unconscious and bleeding, Jay, as his wife's
        letter to her mother of 17 April 1788 discloses, was
        carried home for emergency medical attention. Even
        reinforcements of a company of sabre-wielding cavalry
        galloping up Broadway failed to bring the rioting to
        a halt until the following day [<em>Sarah Livingston
        Jay to Susannah Livingston,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.06480" target="_blank" class="">6480</a>].
        For a time it was thought that Jay had suffered permanent
        brain damage. Evidently before this serious accident
        Jay must have completed his <em>Address to the People
        of New York</em>, a pamphlet which ranks with the <em>Federalist</em> letters
        as among the most notable contributions of the pro-Constitution
        camp to the ratification movement. </p>
      <p class="justified12px">After the onset of Jay's illness in late November
        of 1787, Madison took up the slack with alacrity, contributing
        Nos. 10 and 14 to the section on the "utility
        of the Union," and three more. Nos. 18, 19, and
        20, to the topic of the "insufficiency of the
        present Confederacy to preserve that Union." Madison
        then proceeded to contribute his insightful analysis
        of the text of the Constitution.</p>
      <a name="authorship"></a>
      <h4 align="">The Matter of Authorship</h4>
      <p class="justified12px"> Of the eighty-five <em>Federalist</em> letters, all
        published under the pseudonym "Publius" (the
        name taken from Publius Valerius Publicola, a founder
        and defender of the Roman republic), only four drafts
        are extant, and all four are in Jay's hand. It remains
        a mystery to this day why not a single one of the fifty
        letters attributed to Alexander Hamilton and the twenty-nine
        to Madison have been preserved except in printed form.
        Considering the fact that both Hamilton and Madison
        were meticulous collectors of their own writings and
        shared a profound sense of the importance of documenting
        the principal activities in which they were engaged,
        their disappearance must be attributed to an intense
        desire for anonymity at the time the letters were composed
        and transmitted to the printer. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> The authors meant to keep the identity of "Publius" a
        well-guarded secret to avoid prejudicing readers who
        might be persuaded by arguments had they not been put
        off by the names of the conspicuous Federalists who
        were the authors. Madison revealed his role and the
        names of his collaborators in private correspondence
        but in New York not more than a corporal's guard must
        have known for sure of Hamilton's involvement. Jay's
        connection was even a deeper secret. Indeed, he was
        forced to deny a sensational rumor that he was opposed
        to the Constitution. Obviously, among Antifederalists
        his authorship of some of the <em>Federalist</em> essays
        was not even a matter of speculation. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> The absurd rumor about Jay's opposition to the Constitution
        first surfaced on 24 November 1787, when Philadelphia's <em>Independent
        Gazetteer</em> reported an unnamed source as relating
        that "his Excellency John Jay, (a gentleman of
        the first rate abilities, joined to a good heart) who
        at first was carried away with the new plan of government,
        is now very decidedly against it, and says it is as
        deep and wicked a conspiracy as has been ever invented
        in the darkest ages against the liberties of a free
        people." The report was quickly reprinted in newspapers
        across the Eastern seaboard. Jay's friends stamped
        the story as an incredible invention. As Washington
        put it, "It is very unlikely therefore that a
        man of his knowledge and foresight should turn on both
        sides of a question in so short a space. I am anxious
        however to know the foundation (if any) for this." Washington
        rightly suspected that "the enemies of the Constitution
        leave no stone unturned to encrease the opposition
        to it." In reply, Madison branded the report an "arrant
        forgery," and warned the General that "tricks
        of this sort are not unknown with the Enemies of the
        Constitution." </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> As for Jay himself, he was quickly alerted. Tench
        Coxe in Philadelphia sent a copy of the newspaper to
        David L. Franks, requesting him to "shew it to
        Mr. Jay." Jay quickly authorized the publication
        of his denial [<em>Jay to John Vaughan, 1 December,
        1787,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.08166" target="_blank" class="">8166</a>, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.02566" target="_blank" class="">2566</a>],
        and it was listed by "One of the People" in
        a refutation of "Antifederal Arguments," appearing
        in the <em>Baltimore Maryland Journal</em>, 25 December
        1787, wherein this and other "deceptions" were
        exposed. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> Had Jay's role in the writing of the <em>Federalist</em> been
        even suspected, it is highly unlikely that this trial
        balloon would have been floated. Moreover, by 24 November,
        the day the story first broke, Jay had withdrawn from
        the series because of illness, a fact that might have
        lent credibility to the allegation had his participation
        been known. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> Whatever confusion of attribution survived publication
        of the <em>Federalist</em> was compounded by the desire
        of both Hamilton and Madison at different periods of
        their lives to set the record straight and claim the
        credit for their respective contributions. In Jay's
        case it was left for his family to do so. It is known
        that John Jay II once had possession of all five of
        his grandfather's letters, but as of September 1891,
        when the third volume of Jay's <em>Correspondence and
        Public Papers</em> appeared, its editor noted that
        the original draft of No. 2 was no longer extant. Although
        published anonymously like all eighty-five letters,
        there can be no dispute about Jay's authorship of these
        five letters in view of his holograph drafts and other
        incontrovertible evidence. In fact, Jay's authorship
        of these letters has never been seriously disputed.
        Some confusion, however, arose about No. 64, written
        on Jay's restoration of health, and it came about the
        following way. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> Numerous lists identifying the authorship of the
        individual <em>Federalist</em> essays have been attributed
        to both Hamilton and Madison; significantly, no such
        list has been attributed to Jay. The most authentic
        Hamilton list is found on the inside cover of Chancellor
        James Kent's copy of <em>The Federalist</em> (first
        edition, 1788), now in possession of Columbia University
        Library. Kent wrote: "I am assured that Numbers
        2, 3, 4, and 54 were written by John Jay," but
        the number "6" was superimposed over the "5" in "54" in
        Hamilton's own handwriting. &nbsp;Kent appended this
        notation to the list: "N.B. I showed this above
        mem. to General Hamilton in my office in Albany and
        he said it was correct saving the correction above
        made." Beneath this notation Kent wrote: "I
        have no doubt Mr. Jay wrote No. 64 on the Treaty Power.
        He made a Speech on that Subject in the N.Y. Convention,
        and I am told he says he wrote it. I suspect therefore
        from internal Ev[idence] the above to be the correct
        List, and not the one on the opposite page."</p>
      <p class="justified12px"> The "Kent list" thus becomes the only evidence
        of authorship in Hamilton's hand which is now extant.
        Because it refers to Hamilton as "General" and
        because the conversation alluded to took place in Albany,
        it was presumably written between 1800, the year in
        which Hamilton resumed his law practice after having
        been occupied with his duties as Inspector-General
        of the Army, and 1804. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> In the 14 November 1807 issue of the Philadelphia
        magazine, <em>The Portfolio</em>, notations reputed
        to be in Hamilton's handwriting and marked in a copy
        of <em>The Federalist</em>, attributed to Jay's authorship
        Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, and 54, and this attribution cropped
        up again in the so-called "Benson list," which
        Hamilton allegedly wrote in the office of his longtime
        friend, Judge Egbert Benson, two days before his duel
        with Burr. Therein the attribution of No. 54 to Jay
        was quickly corrected by a friend of Hamilton as an
        obvious slip for 64 when it was published. In any event,
        the unsigned memorandum on which the report was based
        mysteriously disappeared, and its evidential value
        has a lower ranking than the "Kent list." </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> Madison, whose recollection of the respective authorship
        of <em>The Federalist</em> letters has been substantiated
        by studies of the internal evidence, may also have
        been guilty of a slip of memory in regard to No. 64.
        An article signed "Corrector," which appeared
        in the <em>National Intelligencer</em> of 20 March
        1817, and which according to its anonymous author was
        copied from "a pencilled memorandum in the handwriting
        of Mr. Madison," stated on "indubitable authority" that "Mr.
        Madison wrote Nos. 10, 14, 18, 19, 20, 37, 38, 39,
        40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52,
        53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 62, 63, and 64. Mr. Jay wrote
        Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5; and Mr. Hamilton the residue." Note
        that in this instance "64" could not have
        been a slip for "54," which is also, and
        in this case correctly, claimed for Madison. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> When the historian-editor Henry B. Dawson was at
        work on his edition of <em>The Federalist</em>, which
        he published in 1864, he asked John Jay II to see the
        draft of No. 64, then in the Jay family possession.
        Jay's grandson obliged, and according to Dawson sent
        him "the original drafts of number LXIII" (later
        renumbered LXIV). Instead of returning them to the
        sender, as he had been explicitly directed to do, Dawson
        left the originals with the New-York Historical Society,
        and the librarian of that institution neglected to
        return the material to the Jay family. One of the two
        drafts remained in the Society's manuscript collection,
        its existence unknown until 1959, when Dr. Catharine
        S. Crary, a member of the staff of The Papers of John
        Jay, uncovered it in a box of Jay letters. If there
        was in fact a second draft, it has never been located
        since the Dawson-John Jay II exchange. In a memorandum
        accompanying the Historical Society's draft of No.
        64, John Jay II stated: "Mr. Hamilton never claimed
        it, but Mr. Madison, although in one and I believe
        two clarifications of the authorship of the various
        numbers attributed 64 to Jay; in another, attributed
        54 to Jay and 64 to himself." </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> In fairness to Madison, however, that contributor
        was either misquoted by "Corrector" or must
        have suffered a pardonable and rare lapse of memory
        in such matters. In three other places Madison correctly
        attributed No. 64 to Jay: (1) in an article in the <em>City
        of Washington Gazette</em>, 15 December 1817, which
        published a list claiming to have been "furnished
        by Madison himself"; (2) in the edition of The
        Federalist published in 1818 by Jacob Gideon, which
        based its attribution of authorship on James Madison's
        own "copy of the work which that gentleman had
        preserved for himself" (the 1809 edition by John
        Tiebout now in the Library of Congress); and (3) in
        a marginal note in Madison's hand found in a copy of <em>The
        Federalist</em>, belonging to Richard Rush, Attorney
        General in President Madison's Cabinet. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> The fact is that only one <em>Federalist</em> draft,
        that of No. 5, remained in the possession of the Jay
        family when the Jay Papers were acquired by Columbia
        University in 1959. Copies of all known drafts have
        been made available to the John Jay Papers through
        the courtesy of the present or former owners. As the
        draft versions were undated, the editors have arbitrarily
        assigned to the drafts the date when the respective
        published version first appeared. </p>
      <a name="texts"></a>
      <h4 align="">The Texts
        of John Jay’s <em>Federalist</em> Letters</h4>
      <p class="justified12px"> Jay's letters Nos. 2 through 5 first appeared in <em>The
        Independent Journal, or The General Advertiser</em> ,
        a semi-weekly paper edited by John McLean and Co.,
        and a day or two later in both <em>The New-York Packet</em> (edited
        by Samuel and John Loudon) and <em>The Daily Advertiser</em>,
        edited by Jay's former protege, Francis Childs. No.
        64 first appeared in The Independent Journal of 5
        March 1788, followed on 7 March with publication
        in The New-York Packet. In its original newspaper
        version it bore the number "63," but was
        renumbered in the first collected edition. All of
        Jay's essays appear in that first edition, printed
        by J. and A. McLean, corrected by Hamilton and published
        on 22 March 1788. A second volume, containing the
        final batch of essays and containing no contributions
        from Jay, came off the press on 28 May 1788. In addition
        to the McLean edition there were two further American
        editions and two French editions published during
        Hamilton's lifetime. The third American edition (1802),
        printed by George F. Hopkins, contained revisions
        made by John Wells, a New York lawyer, presumably
        approved by Hamilton. Hamilton himself appears to
        have made some minor changes in the essays written
        by Jay, but there is no evidence that Jay participated
        in either proofreading or revising any of these editions.
        In addition, Madison supplied Jacob Gideon, Jr.,
        a printer of Washington, D.C., with corrections of
        the papers he had authored. The Gideon edition came
        off the press in 1818. </p>
      <a name="variances"></a>
      <h4 align="">Variances
        Between Jay's Drafts and the Printed Versions</h4>
      <p class="justified12px"> A careful workman even under pressure, Jay labored
        over the drafts of the <em>Federalist</em> letters
        printed below, and the published versions differ in
        some cases in significant ways, markedly in the case
        of No. 64. Jay's first extant draft, <em>Federalist</em> No.
        3, followed up on the theme of the previous Jay letter,
        for which no draft has been located. <em>Federalist</em> No.
        2 stressed the sources of national unity, while overlooking
        a number of compelling areas of deep division--regional,
        ethnic, social, racial, and religious--and underplayed
        the opposition of a minority at the Constitutional
        Convention to the document as finally adopted. Jay's
        stirring concluding line quoted Cardinal Wolsey's comment
        when he learned of Henry VIII's decision to retire
        him, as Shakespeare has immortalized it (<em>King Henry
        VIII</em> , Act III, scene 2). </p>
      <p class="justified12px"><em> Federalist</em> No. 3 [&nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.13367" target="_blank" class="">13367</a> (no
        image)] opens with one of the rare passages in Jay's
        writings praising the American people as "intelligent
        and well informed." In the draft, significantly,
        the phrase "left to the" was excised and "well
        informed" appears without this critical reservation. &nbsp;This
        third letter focused on the role of a strong central
        government in preserving peace and security. The essay's
        principal significance lay in its incisive criticism
        of the separate states, which Jay depicted as more
        vulnerable to local pressures, more impulsive, more
        aggressive, and less able to manage foreign policy.
        One substantive change between the draft and the published
        version appears in the judicial machinery for the enforcement
        of treaties. Jay deleted the phrase "national
        courts" and substituted "courts appointed
        by, and responsible only to one national Government...." This
        change reflected his sensitivity to the fears shared
        by Antifederalists of a large federal judiciary administering
        a body of federal common law and undermining the authority
        of the state courts. Even Federalists like John Rutledge
        of South Carolina considered the establishment of inferior
        federal tribunals as "making an unnecessary encroachment
        on the jurisdiction [of the states], and creating unnecessary
        obstacles to their adoption of the new system." The
        Federal Convention had sidestepped the issue in Article
        III, which vests the judicial power in a Supreme Court "and
        in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time
        to time ordain and establish." Jay tried to handle
        the ticklish issue with circumspection after reflecting
        the opinion of international jurists like Grotius in
        their differentiation between "just" and "unjust" wars,
        making the unique point that the federal government
        would be in a better position under the Constitution
        to prevent bellicosity on the part of the Americans
        themselves. Jay assumes, then, that all wars in which
        Americans participate were not necessarily just ones,
        and that the nation might be drawn into wars fomented
        by one or two states. Then a significant assertion: "Not
        a single Indian war has yet been occasioned by aggression
        of the present Foederal Government, feeble as it is,
        but there are several instances of Indian hostilities
        having been provoked by the improper conduct of individual
        States, who either unable or unwilling to restrain
        or punish offenders, have given occasion to the slaughter
        of many innocent inhabitants." In his <em>Explaining
        America: The Federalist,</em> Garry Wills incisively
        commented on this passage: "For more than a century,
        in the history of the republic Jay was arguing for,
        condemnations of fellow Americans for slaughtering
        Indians would be rarely heard and harshly received.
        The virtuous republic disappears when people no longer
        question their own virtue." </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> In the draft of <em>Federalist</em> &nbsp;No. 4 [&nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.13331" target="_blank" class="">13331</a> (no
        image)], Jay anticipated the treatment of parties and
        factions which was developed in Madison's celebrated
        initial contribution, <em>Federalist</em> &nbsp;No.
        10. Pursuing the theme of the importance of national
        union in averting conflicts with foreign powers, Jay
        begins with a quotation attributed to Addison on the
        effects of party conflicts: "The Parties and Divisions
        amongst us may [in] several Ways bring destruction
        upon our Country, at the same time that one united
        house would secure us against all the Attempts of a
        foreign Enemy." Then in the final paragraph of
        the draft Jay speculated that if foreign governments "find
        us either...destitute of an effectual Government...or
        split into Factions or three or four independent...Republics
        or Confederacies...what a poor pitiful Figure will
        America make?" Jay therein acknowledges the weight
        of one of the most forceful contemporary arguments
        against party and faction, the likelihood that they
        would lead to foreign penetration and the establishment
        of outposts of alien influence in American public life.
        In these fleeting references, which he subsequently
        suppressed and did not publish, Jay was obviously referring
        to the relationship between factions and geographic
        divisions. He must have concluded that the subject
        deserved more concentrated attention in a future installment,
        and it was to be Madison not Jay who would pick up
        the theme of "the spirit of party and faction." </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> The draft of <em>Federalist</em>&nbsp; No. 5 [&nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.10401" target="_blank" class="">10401</a>]
        reveals Jay's tendency as a prudent lawyer to tone
        down his language and avoid stridency. For example,
        in the seventh paragraph of the draft Jay originally
        observed that "they who find themselves unjustly
        suspected of unkind Intentions, are by that very Circumstance
        naturally led to entertain them"--a phrase which
        may have proved too revealing about Jay and his Federalist
        associates, or, more likely, enkindle suspicions about
        Federalists which Jay preferred not to arouse. He chose
        instead the more guarded language which appears in
        the final text: "Distrust naturally creates Distrust
        and by nothing is good will and Kind Conduct more speedily
        changed, than by invidious Jealousies and uncandid
        Imputations expressed or implied." </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> A second, more substantive, change was made in the
        very next paragraph of the draft. Discussing the potential
        for future hostility between a Northern and Southern
        confederation should America fail to unite under the
        proposed Constitution, Jay revealed certain Northern
        prejudices in his speculation that Northerners would "be
        tempted to gather honey in the more blooming fields
        and milder air of their luxurious and more delicate
        neighbours." Jay retained the adjectives "luxurious" and "delicate" in
        his final version in preference to "less hardy
        and less enterprizing Neighbors," which he deleted.
        Jay must have realized that, although the <em>Federalist</em> was
        aimed at a New York audience, important Southern states
        still had to be persuaded to ratify the Constitution. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> The paragraph that immediately follows is the longest
        in Jay's original draft of <em>Federalist</em> No.
        5. Jay's draft suggested that mutual suspicion among
        the "three or four Confederacies" likely
        to emerge in the event the Constitution were rejected
        would create military establishments which "would
        oftener be turned against each other than against a
        foreign Enemy...." Jay must have concluded that
        the subject of standing armies, to which he had been
        led by his treatment of the consequences of disunion,
        needed more detailed analysis than could comfortably
        be contained within this one essay. Hamilton does give
        the subject a full-dress treatment in a later installment. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> The concluding set of major changes from the original
        draft to the finished version of <em>Federalist</em> No.
        5 reveals Jay's sound editorial judgment in cutting
        down verbiage, with the reduction of three paragraphs
        to two, and in concluding with a single, pithy sentence.
        Here the major substantive alteration is the deletion
        of another provocative sentence, both out of place
        and striking an unnecessarily discordant note: "Wicked
        Men of great Talents and ambition are the Growth of
        every Soil, and seldom hesitate to precipitate their
        Country into any Wars and Connections which may promote
        their Designs." There was enough history to substantiate
        the assertion, with its prophetic cast, but sober second
        thoughts prompted its omission. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"><em> Federalist</em> No. 64 [&nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.10753" target="_blank" class="">10753</a>],
        Jay's most important statement in the series to which
        he contributed--the only one of the five he wrote which
        deals with the text of the Constitution--draws upon
        his acknowledged experience in foreign affairs. Jay
        reworked this essay more than any of its predecessors,
        and in its published version it is substantially compressed
        and rewritten. These revisions suggest the possibility
        that Jay incorporated suggestions from Hamilton and
        even Madison, who left New York a day or two before
        No. 64 was published. Comparing the fourth paragraph
        of the draft with the third paragraph of the published
        version reveals Jay's constant effort to achieve a
        crisper style. Paragraphs five, six, and seven of the
        draft were either dropped or reworked. He deleted these
        specific verbatim points: (1) "The People at large
        may sometimes by Negligence or other Causes be led...into
        indiscreet appointments...." (2) "The State
        Legislatures very seldom lost Sight of their obvious
        Interests, or commit their Management to Men in whom
        they have little or no Confidence"; (3) "The
        People of America have not been hitherto sufficiently
        sensible of [the] Importance" of "the absolute
        Necessity of order and System in the Conduct of...national
        Affairs"; (4) "We must suppose that the Members
        from each State, however well disposed to promote the
        general good of the whole, will yet be still more strongly
        disposed to promote that of their immediate Constituents." The
        above statements reflect Jay's own doubts about the
        judgment of the people and his conviction that state
        legislatures were actuated by parochial rather than
        national interests. On second thought he must have
        realized that an essay designed to have popular appeal
        should not strike either note. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> The paragraphs on "trade and navigation" and
        the necessity for secrecy and dispatch in the management
        of foreign policy (the last, a time-tested favorite
        of Jay's) similarly caused Jay stylistic problems,
        but they also include a variance of the first importance
        from the final version. In discussing treaty-making,
        the draft reads: "The Convention have done well
        therefore in so disposing of this power of making Treaties
        as that <s>while they</s> although the president <s>is
        restrained by</s>, must in forming them act by the
        Advice and Consent of the Senate, yet <s>that he will
        be under no obligation to </s>he will be able to manage
        all affairs of secret Intelligence in the way in which
        Prudence and Circumstances may suggest." Compare
        this with the published version: "The convention
        have done well therefore in so disposing of the power
        of making treaties, that although the president must
        in forming them act by the advice and consent of the
        senate, yet he will be able to manage the business
        of Intelligence in such manner as prudence may suggest." Then
        follows in both the draft and final version Jay's opinion
        that the President could decide in "preparatory
        and auxiliary measures" the circumstances "which
        require the advice and consent of the Senate...." Clearly
        Jay interpreted the "advice and consent" provision
        of Article 2 of the Constitution to be a requirement
        in "forming" treaties but not in either preliminary
        negotiation or in steps to carry them out. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> There is, however, at least a hint that Jay believed
        that the President could not act unilaterally in terminating
        a treaty. Both the draft and the published version
        contain this sentence: "They who make laws may
        without Doubt repeal them and it is equally true that
        they who make Treaties may alter and annul them." This
        observation seems to argue for the view that the advice
        and consent of the Senate are needed to terminate a
        treaty validly. Omitted erroneously from the printed
        newspaper version is the crucial sentence: "With
        Respect to the Responsibility of the President and
        the Senate, it is difficult to conceive how it could
        be increased." Jay's position on this question
        seems reinforced by his opinion in <em>Jones v. Walker</em>,
        written some six years later while he sat in the Virginia
        circuit as Chief Justice. Therein Jay maintained that
        a treaty could not be repealed or annulled but by the
        will of those who have authority to repeal or annul
        it, and that "no right can be incident to the
        judiciary to declare it void in a single instance." </p>
      <p class="justified12px"><em> Federalist</em> No. 64 goes on to deal with those
        provisions of the Constitution which declared that
        treaties had the force of law and that treaties made
        in pursuance of the Constitution were "the supreme
        law of the land." This interpretation is in accord
        with the supremacy clause of the Constitution, a provision
        founded upon the resolution of Congress of&nbsp;April
        1787 that Jay had drafted. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> In refuting the Antifederalist objections that under
        the Constitution two-thirds of the states could "oppress
        the remaining third," Jay incorporated a final
        series of changes from draft to published version which
        again opened windows into areas of his thinking, which
        he later chose to conceal. The No. 64 draft draws a
        parallel between the nation and the states reminiscent
        of the nationalist ideas contained in his earlier letters
        to Adams and Lowell mentioned above. As the original
        draft phrased it, "Every objection to the federal
        Constitution which [these criticisms] imply may at
        least with equal force be applied to this State [New
        York]. <em>Will</em> the Governor and the Legislature
        of New York make Laws with an equal Eye to the Interest
        of all the Counties." On reflection, Jay deleted
        this passage from his final text. The notion of reducing
        the status of the states vis-à-vis the federal
        government to that comparable to the standing of their
        own counties within the state would have ignited those
        very fires of suspicion which the <em>Federalist</em> letters
        were designed to allay. In the published letter Jay
        also dropped the last two concluding paragraphs, which
        by proposing that the treaty-making powers be given "a
        fair trial" weakened his argument. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> While the explication of <em>The Federalist</em> has
        burgeoned over the years, it is difficult to estimate
        its immediate impact on the public. The pro-ratification
        press in New York was laudatory, as were various correspondents
        of Jay and his collaborators. How many Antifederal
        voters were converted is speculative. For example,
        writing from "Flat Bush" on 24 December 1787,
        some "27 subscribers" informed the <em>New-York
        Packet</em> that they were tired of seeing "Publius" in
        every paper and asked the printer to discontinue publishing
        the series.</p>
      <a name="address"></a>
      <h4 align="">JAY'S <i>"AN
        ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW-YORK ON
        THE SUBJECT OF THE CONSTITUTION" </i>(March-April
        1788) </h4>
      <p class="justified12px"> Some time between the appearance of <em>Federalist</em> No.
        64 in March 1788 and the Doctors' Riot, which occurred
        in mid-April, was the period when Jay wrote his seminal
        paper, <em><a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/exhibitions/constitution/address/index.html"><u>An
        Address to the People of the State of New-York, On
        the Subject of the Constitution, Agreed upon at Philadelphia,
        the 17th of September, 1987</u></a></em>.
        The <em>Address</em> was expected off the press by
        the 12th April, based on Jay's draft letter to Washington
        of that date, a day before Jay was seriously injured
        in the street violence of New York.&nbsp; It was written
        prior to the spring election of delegates
        to the state ratifying convention and indubitably aimed
        at influencing the electors' choices. No draft of the <em>Address</em> is
        known to be extant. It has been evaluated as "far
        more important" than <em>The Federalist</em> to
        the political battle to get the Constitution ratified
        in New York. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> The <em>Address</em> appeared as an anonymous pamphlet,
        considerably longer in text and more wide-ranging in
        subject matter than any of Jay's <em>Federalist</em> letters.
        Unlike the letters of "Publius," Jay's <em>Address</em> dealt
        with specific Antifederalist criticisms, most importantly
        those dealing with the absence of a bill of rights
        in the proposed Constitution and the desirability,
        as the Antifederalists saw it, of calling a second
        convention. The pamphlet format gave Jay ample opportunity
        to answer these points and to review the major arguments
        in favor of the Constitution: the weakness of Congress
        under the Confederation, the "virtue" and
        near unanimity of the Philadelphia framers, the Constitution's
        safeguards against the concentration of too much power,
        the unlikelihood that a better plan could be agreed
        upon by a second meeting, and the consequences to the
        nation of rejecting the proposed Constitution. The <em>Address</em> was
        distinguished by its moderate tone and soundness of
        judgment. Jay's wife reported from Elizabethtown that
        it was received "with great approbation." [<em>Sarah
        Jay to Jay, June 19, 1788,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.06520" target="_blank" class="">6520</a>] &nbsp;A
        more objective observer, writing from Poughkeepsie
        on 3 June, remarked: "Had the pamphlet attributed
        to Mr. Jay made its appearance a little sooner, I am
        well persuaded there would have been a still more complete
        revolution in the minds of the people. That publication
        treated the subject as relative to us in the proper
        light: as the States one after another came into the
        measure the great political controversy gradually changed
        its ground, and what was once a question on the <em>merits</em> of
        the Constitution now becomes only a question of public
        expediency and policy." Jay resisted Franklin's
        suggestion that he make his authorship known in order
        to add to the weight of the document [<em>Jay to John
        Vaughan, June 27, 1788,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.02567" target="_blank" class="">2567</a>, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.08144" target="_blank" class=""> 8144</a>],
        but, according to Sarah Livingston Jay, Jay's "well
        known style" gave him away in any case. [<em>June
        19, 1788,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.06520" target="_blank" class="">6520</a>] &nbsp;On
        8 June 1788, Washington sent Madison a copy, although
        he had "little doubt" of Madison's having
        received a copy of it. "It is written with much
        good sense &amp; moderation. I conjecture but upon
        no certain ground, that Mr. Jay is the author of it.
        He sent it to me sometime ago, since which I have received
        two or three more copies." As Jay's major literary
        contribution to the campaign for ratification in New
        York, the <em>Address</em> earned an esteem comparable
        to that of the seventy-seven <em>Federalist</em> letters
        published prior to the elections for delegates to the
        New York State ratifying. </p>
      <a name="ratifying"></a>
      <h4 align="">JAY AT THE NEW YORK RATIFYING CONVENTION<br>
        (June-July 1788)</h4>
      <p class="justified12px"> In the critical battles that lay ahead in the state
        of New York, the pro-ratification party or Federalists
        counted themselves fortunate in being able to draw
        upon Jay's literary and forensic ammunition. On 31
        January 1788 New York State Senator Egbert Benson proposed
        to the state legislature that the delegates to the
        ratifying convention be chosen in the same number as
        the state assemblymen by "all free male citizens
        of the age of twenty-one years and upwards" and
        that they meet in Poughkeepsie the third Thursday in
        June. Despite the obstructionist efforts of the Antifederalists
        and the distinct coolness of their leader, Governor
        George Clinton, both houses passed the resolution setting
        elections for the end of April. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> Nominees for New York City's delegates were not limited
        to the two opposing blocs, but were initiated informally
        and in response to a groundswell of recognition of
        the quality of the Federalist leadership, notably of
        Jay. As early as 20 February 1788, Jay's name appeared
        on a list of candidates offered to "Friends and
        fellow citizens." After proposing Jay's name,
        the writer asserted: "From his long services abroad
        and at home, and the nature of his present office as
        minister of foreign affairs, [he] must [be] supposed
        to possess the best information of any man in the United
        States, on our relative situation with foreign nations." Within
        a few weeks "An Independent Elector" and "A
        Citizen" included Jay on their proposed slates.
        A more formal "Federal Ticket" for New York
        City and County was proposed on 9 April on behalf of "a
        number of your fellow citizens" by Thomas Randall,
        prominent New York merchant and ex-Tory. Others rushed
        to join in endorsement, including groups styling themselves "mechanics
        and tradesmen," "a very numerous meeting
        of Germans, inhabitants of the city," "A
        Citizen and friend of GOOD ORDER," "a number
        of your Customers," and a long nominating article
        including the name of Jay appeared in the press on
        22 April. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> Laudatory references to Jay were by no means uncommon.
        A contributor to Childs' <em>Daily Advertiser</em> in
        the 21 March issue not only included Jay on his own
        list but, for the benefit of voters who had been out
        of the city during the war years, added this observation
        about the Secretary for Foreign Affairs: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="justified12px"> The distinguished abilities, and unshaken integrity
          of Mr. Jay, recommended him at an early period of
          life, to all his acquaintance, as well as to the
          notice of the British Government, in the late Province
          of New-York, antecedent to the war, insomuch, that
          he would have been appointed to one of the first
          offices in that Province, upon the first vacancy
          that should happen. Nevertheless when the rights
          of his country became invaded by the British, he
          took a decided and active part in her favor; his
          uniform services since, both at home and abroad,
          particularly in the formation of the Treaty of Peace,
          so peculiarly advantageous and beneficial to the
          interest of the United States; in the management
          and prosecution of which, he had a principal share.
          Mr. Jay's legal knowledge is incontrovertible; his
          arguments are methodically arranged and drawn forth
          with judgment; he reasons logically and well, and
          excells most men in dissecting the arguments of his
          opponents and rendering them futile and nugatory;
          he is able and pointed in reply, and possesses the
          powers of persuasion in an eminent degree; in short
          Mr. Jay is endowed with the necessary qualifications
          to constitute a statesman. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="justified12px"> Nominations continued throughout the month of April,
        including a Federalist rhymester whose doggerel ran: </p>
      <div align="">
            <p class="justified12px"> Mr. Jay, Col. Hamilton, Harrison,
                Low<br>
                Are honest, good patriots all of us know. </p>
      </div>
      <p class="justified12px"> Jay's name was also included in a nine-man slate
        adopted at a meeting "of a large number of respectable
        Mechanics and Tradesmen" assembled late that month
        at Vandewater's Tavern and chaired by Daniel Dunscomb. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> Pro-Jay and pro-Federalist doggerel drew a response
        from one critic who, in offering a Jay slate, added
        with obvious sarcasm: </p>

      </div>
      <p class="justified12px"> On the eve of the election a group of "Many
        Federalists" issued a broadside which sought to
        controvert the anti-lawyer bias of some Antifederalists.
        They urged the electors "to chuse a less number
        of Lawyers," perhaps two, and proposed a slate
        of nine, significantly headed by lawyers John Jay and
        Alexander Hamilton, but with seven others, principally
        businessmen. Whether this was in fact a devious tactic
        of the Antifederalists to alert the voters to the dangers
        inherent in the proposed Constitution, which permitted
        the federal judiciary to intermeddle with the state
        courts, is a distinct possibility. A broadside which
        casts aspersions on the integrity of the legal profession
        could hardly be acceptable to a Jay or a Hamilton.
        Significantly, aside from Hamilton and Jay, none of
        the remainder of the slate was chosen. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> Jay had predicted that the election would be "the
        most contested of any we have had since the Revolution.” [<em>Jay

        did not prove correct, for there the Antifederalists
        did not even enter a slate, although some scattered
        votes were cast for their candidates. Some 2,836 ballots
        were cast, the largest number yet recorded in a New
        York City election. </p>

      <p class="justified12px">Contrariwise, upstate the Antifederalists scored sweeping
        victories, giving them a more than two-to-one majority
        of Convention delegates, but only fifty-six percent
        of the total vote cast. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> Long before the results of the balloting were known
        Jay realistically appraised the situation as "so
        formidable that the Issue appears problematical." [<em>Jay
        to Washington, April 20, 1788,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.10395" target="_blank" class="">10395</a>, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.08428" target="_blank" class="">8428</a>]
        Yet hardly three weeks before the opening of the Poughkeepsie
        Convention, Jay seems to have worked out the strategy
        for the Federalist camp. While writing Washington on
        29 May that the majority of the delegation comprised "anti-fœderal
        Characters," he then deleted from his original
        draft his expression of regret that the election had
        been delayed as "the Constitution continues [to]
        gain ground daily." The opposition had used "improper
        means" to deceive and alarm the people, "and
        with very considerable Success," but, he added, "Truth
        is constantly extending and will prevail." In
        his draft Jay pointed out that these methods had aroused
        much indignation, that it was doubtful "whether
        the Leaders will be able to govern the Party," and
        that "many in the opposition are friends to Union
        and mean well" while their leaders were "very
        far from being Sollicitous about the Fate of the Union." The
        leaders wanted the Constitution rejected swiftly with
        as little debate as possible, but he doubted whether
        their followers would take such "desperate" measures.
        The implication was clear: insist on full debate and
        divide the opposition on tactics. A second point Jay
        made was found in the remark that "An Idea has
        taken air that the Southern part of the State will
        at all Events adhere to the Union, and if necessary
        to that End seek a Separation from the northern." That
        contingency was one of which the opposition was fearful
        and with which they had no plans to cope. Jay struck
        out a last observation: "The Truth is," he
        added, "that few among them are remarkable for
        talents," but these men "may perhaps occasion" trouble.
        [<em>Jay to Washington, May 29, 1788,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.10397" target="_blank" class="">10397</a>; <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.08430" target="_blank" class="">8430</a>] </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> Jay's observations were indeed shrewd. Instead of
        deep-seated opposition to the idea of a federal union,
        there was a fairly general consensus that the Confederation
        had to be replaced with something better. Bear in mind
        that New York had been the very first state to propose
        a general convention to revise the Articles of Confederation
        and had done so back in July of 1782. What the more
        persuadable Antifederalists really sought six years
        later were assurances that the defects of the proposed
        Constitution could be remedied. Thus, four days after
        the Convention met, Jay wrote his wife that the "Proceedings
        and Debates have been temperate, and inoffensive to
        either Party," even though, and he underscored
        this, "<em>The opposition to the proposed Constitution
        appears formidable</em>, the more so from numbers than
        other Considerations." [<em>Jay to Sarah Jay,
        June 21, 1788,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.05303" target="_blank" class="">5303</a>, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.04018" target="_blank" class="">4018</a> (no
        images)] </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> Jay might have added that two days earlier the Federalist
        strategy that he had outlined in his letter to Washington
        was set in motion. On June 19th the Convention adopted
        the resolution offered by Jay's former law partner,
        Robert R. Livingston, "That no question, general
        or particular, should be put in the committee upon
        the proposed Constitution of Government for the United
        States, or upon any clause or article thereof, nor
        upon any amendment which should be reposed thereto,
        until after the said Constitution and amendments should
        have been considered <em>clause by clause."</em> This,
        the Jay strategy, would ensure ultimate victory for
        the Federalists. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> From this point on the Constitution was debated article
        by article, and we are able to pursue Jay's own remarks
        on the floor of the convention through some half dozen
        accounts, printed or manuscript. All available reports
        of the convention are fragmentary. The fullest account
        was published by Jay's erstwhile protégé,
        the newspaper printer Francis Childs, who issued a
        set of <em>Debates and Proceedings</em>, which unfortunately
        lacks a record of debates beyond June 28th and thereafter
        merely summarizes motions introduced. Supplementing
        Childs' account is the "Journal of the Proceedings
        of the Convention" kept by the Convention's secretary,
        John McKesson, in the New York State Library, as well
        as his "Notes" in The New-York Historical
        Society. To fill in the missing gaps, and for comparative
        purposes, the editors also used Melancton Smith's "Notes" in
        the State Library, the notes of Gilbert Livingston
        of Dutchess County, which contain the most complete
        record for the period beginning July 14th, in the New
        York Public Library, the fragmentary account by Robert
        R. Livingston in The New-York Historical Society, and
        the fragment by Robert Lansing covering June 27-28
        in the Genet Papers at the Library of Congress. Finally,
        the editors have had to take into account contemporary
        newspaper coverage as well as Jay's correspondence
        during his weeks at Poughkeepsie. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> Jay's early appearance on the floor of the Poughkeepsie
        Convention caught the fancy of a correspondent for
        the <em>New York Daily Advertiser</em>. Reporting Jay's
        initial remarks, he wrote under date of 21 June, "After
        the Chancellor had concluded, Mr. Jay arose, commanding
        pleasure and satisfaction; and, no doubt, he spoke
        convincingly on the points raised. He has the most
        peculiar knack of expressing himself I ever heard.
        Fancy, passion, in short everything that makes an orator,
        he is a stranger to; and yet none who hear but are
        pleased with him, and captivated beyond expression." A
        gentleman in Poughkeepsie writing to his friend in
        Connecticut, under date of 26 June, "found Mr.
        Jay's reasoning" to be "weighty as gold,
        polished as silver and strong as steel." </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> From his initial speech on 23 June, in which he examined
        Article I, section 2, clause 3, supporting the ratio
        of one representative to 30,000 persons, Jay stressed
        moderation and persuasion. He continually pointed out
        areas of agreement with his opponents, such as the
        need for a strong, energetic federal government (such
        declarations, he remarked, "came from all parts
        of the house"), and distinguished between state
        and federal concerns. He pointed out that the differences
        between the leader of the opposition bloc on the floor,
        the amiable Melancton Smith, and himself over the question
        of proper representation were truly minimal, since
        Smith was willing to have the federal government possess
        the important power of war and peace. For the exercise
        of such great powers Jay was prepared to accept a relatively
        modest proportional representation in the lower house,
        while conceding that a much larger one for the state
        legislature would seem reasonable to deal with internal
        domestic affairs. The truth, as Jay pointed out, was
        that state legislatures were concerned with "innumerable
        things" requiring "such minute and local
        information." The objectives of the general government
        were broad, comprehending "the interests of the
        States in relation to each other, and in relation to
        foreign powers." We do not require our nation's
        representatives to possess minute information about
        Suffolk, or Orange, or Ulster. He himself would have
        preferred a larger representation, Jay admitted, perhaps
        similar to what Melancton Smith desired, but because
        agreements on this figure were so diverse, "I
        think it best to let things stand as they are," he
        remarked. "If I could be convinced that danger
        would probably result from so small a number," he
        added to the opposition, "I should certainly withhold
        my acquiescence." Again, a conciliatory peroration: "We
        did not come here to carry points. If the gentleman
        will convince me I am wrong, I will submit.... <em>It
        is from this reciprocal interchange of ideas, that
        the truth must come out</em>." </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> Two days later Jay rose to reply to Samuel Jones,
        who opposed giving Congress the power of prescribing
        the time, place, and manner of holding elections. Jay
        regarded the Constitutional provision as vital to "prevent
        the dissolution of the Union" in the event that
        a state "by design or accident" should fail
        to choose Senators or Representatives. By this date
        Jay was able to report to Washington that the complexion
        of the Convention was about as anticipated, that neither
        party had really budged the other, and that until the
        rank and file of the Antifederalists realized that
        their leadership was anchored to an extreme position
        no forward movement was likely. Nonetheless, and more
        significantly, he noted that "the greater number" of
        the Antifederalists were, in his opinion, "<em>averse</em> to
        a vote of Rejection." Some would be content with
        recommendatory amendments; others wished for explanatory
        amendments to settle points of doubtful construction.
        Still a third group would insist on amendments precedent
        to ratification, and were even in favor of adjourning
        at that time to wait and see how the new government
        would operate before joining the Union. By this time
        the ninth state, New Hampshire, had ratified, and the
        new union was a fait accompli, a fact which had an
        intangible but significant impact on the course of
        the Poughkeepsie debates. Jay could now tell Washington
        that "the people...are gradually coming right
        notwithstanding the Singular pains taken to prevent
        it." [<em>Jay to Washington</em>, (<em>ca. June
        27, 1788),</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.08431" target="_blank" class="">8431</a>; <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.10398" target="_blank" class="">10398</a>] </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> His relatively optimistic report to Washington notwithstanding,
        Jay was not sanguine about the outcome, writing to
        his friend John Vaughan on June 27th that "the
        issue is uncertain." [<em>Jay to Vaughan, June
        27, 1788,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.02567" target="_blank" class="">2567</a>; <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.08144" target="_blank" class="">8144</a>, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.08167" target="_blank" class="">8167</a>]
        Indeed, Jay had good reason for concern. On the 26th
        of June John Williams, an upstate delegate, had proposed
        a resolution denying Congress the power to impose an
        excise tax on products grown or manufactured in the
        United States, with strict limitations on direct taxes
        (in terms almost anticipating California's Proposition
        13). Jay would have rushed into the fray at once, save
        for the fact that for a day or two Hamilton and Lansing
        were feuding on the floor. Meantime, the opposition
        had confused issues by raising the point of concurrent
        powers of the federal government and the states aside
        from taxation. Jay felt that these observations were "not
        matured"--we would say "half-baked," but
        Jay was always polite. He insisted that until more
        precise points were fashioned it might be wise to go
        home "to cut our Grass" rather than take
        up matters "by halves." Whether Jay and his
        supporters were bluffing or were confident that time
        was on their side would be anyone's educated guess.
        When Governor Clinton, the Convention's presiding officer,
        seemed to call the bluff and asked Jay why he did not
        then move to adjourn, Jay responded by insisting that
        Clinton's side spend some time in clarifying their
        notion of direct taxes. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> The very next day saw Jay take the floor to make
        one of his most telling speeches, when he insisted
        that "a government which was to accomplish national
        purposes should command the national resources." Would
        it be right, he asked, for the interest of a part to
        supplant that of the whole? Distinguishing between
        general and specific taxes, he argued that, as regards
        the latter, Congress would be sufficiently informed
        to make appropriate decisions. As he saw it, no minute
        knowledge was required to impose taxes on luxuries--for
        example, a tax on coaches (thereby anticipating Hamilton's
        carriage tax), or slaves, or plate. Recognizing that
        some ambiguity existed over the question of concurrent
        jurisdiction over taxation, Jay was prepared to have
        an explanatory clause incorporated. "I may be
        cured by an explanatory amendment," McKesson quotes
        him as conceding. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> The Antifederalists now moved beyond seeking to curb
        Congress' taxing power, aiming as well to curb the
        power of the federal government to borrow money. Lansing
        would have required nine states to acquiesce. Jay swiftly
        rose to his feet to point out that "factions" not
        unknown to "republican governments" might
        prevent a third of Congress from allowing the other
        two-thirds from obtaining a loan "when the Exigencies
        of the State required it or when it would be for the
        public Good." Even foreign nations might try to
        prevent Congress from borrowing money in the national
        interest. Jay then informed Governor Clinton that,
        unlike the Senate, where the two-thirds rule was in
        force for treaties and impeachment, the lower house
        had nothing to do with treaties; it represented the
        people whereas the Senate represented the states--for
        the Federalists always a significant distinction. As
        for impeachment, the two-thirds rule was designed to
        prevent factions from removing officials for political
        reasons. Frequently Jay struck a sectional note. In
        case of a war the Western states would have the power
        to refuse a loan to support the defense of the Atlantic
        states, the most likely targets and sufferers in such
        an eventuality. "Would you put it in the power
        of five men to disarm a Continent?," he asked.
        At this point, Hamilton reinforced Jay's arguments
        in a powerful address, stressing national security
        considerations in supporting a loan by majority vote. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> Differences over textual matters, amendments compounding
        amendments--nothing could spoil an Independence Day
        celebration in Poughkeepsie. Despite unsettled weather,
        (it had been steadily raining for days) both factions
        celebrated a feast together--that is, not quite together.
        As Jay described it, "two tables, but in different
        Houses" were laid out for the delegates, but "the
        two Parties mingled at each Table" and toasts
        were announced "by sound of Drum, accompanied
        by the Discharge of Cannon." [<em>Jay to Sarah
        Jay, July 5, 1788,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.04019" target="_blank" class="">4019</a> (no
        image)]. After this display of patriotic good will,
        the two parties settled down to continue their dissection
        of the Constitution. How different was the celebration
        of July 4th in Albany, where Federalists and Antifederalists
        clashed, with one dead and eighteen participants wounded!
        [<em>Jay to Washington, July 8, 1788,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.10400" target="_blank" class="">10400</a>]. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> As of July 4th, Jay could write John Adams that despite
        the "many amendments proposed by the opposition...we
        proceed with much Temper and moderation. I am not without
        Hopes of an accomodation altho my expectations of it
        are not very sanguine." [<em>Jay to Adams, July
        4, 1788,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.06420" target="_blank" class="">6420</a>, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.07467" target="_blank" class="">7467</a>] &nbsp;As
        he remarked to another correspondent that same day,
        there was reason for cautious optimism since the people
        of the southern part of the state were "with great
        unanimity" advocates of the Constitution." "Meantime
        ratification by the other states proceeds." With
        this trend in public opinion Jay felt free to predict
        that the opposition would seek "some line of accomodation
        that they may acquit them with their Partizans." Whether
        this face-saving would involve "<em>conditional</em>" or "<em>recommendatory</em>" amendments
        was still not clear.[<em>Jay to Francis Corbin, July
        4, 1788,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.12844" target="_blank" class="">12844</a>]
        That same day Jay dispatched a congratulatory note
        to Washington on Virginia's ratification. "The
        constitution," he assured the general, "constantly
        gains advocates among the People, and its Enemies in
        the Convention seem to be much embarrassed." [<em>Jay

        Committee of the Whole had completed their examination
        of the Constitution, allowing Jay to write Washington
        that "the ground of <em>Rejection</em>" seemed
        to be "entirely deserted," with the opposition
        reported to be divided on whether to insist on "<em>previous</em> conditional
        amendments," or on "subsequent ones," to
        which latter view the "greater number" were
        disposed.[<em>Jay to Washington, July 8, 1788,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.10400" target="_blank" class="">10400</a>] </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> By the tenth of July some 55 amendments had been
        proposed, which Lansing's motion would have grouped
        into three categories: explanatory, conditional, and
        recommendatory. To deal both with the issue of the
        nature of ratification as well as the amendments a
        fourteen-man committee was appointed. On the Federalist
        side it included Jay, James Duane, John Sloss Hobart,
        Peter Lefferts, and Richard Hatfield. The Antifederalists
        were represented by Robert Yates, Lansing, Melancton
        Smith, Thomas Tredwell, John Haring, Samuel Jones,
        and Gilbert Livingston. What happened in committee
        was not included in the official reports but appears
        in the <em>New York Daily Advertiser</em> of July 15th,
        quoting from a letter from Poughkeepsie, "dated
        in the morning of the 11th instant": "When
        the committee met, Mr. Jay declared that the word <em>conditional</em> should
        be erased before there could be any decision on the
        merits of the amendment; this occasioned about an hour's
        debate, and the Antis determining not to give up that
        point, the committee was dissolved without effecting
        any Thing." Backed by Judge Hobart and other Federalist
        colleagues, Jay argued that a conditional ratification
        amounted "to a virtual and total rejection of
        the Constitution, and declared that they could not
        consult with them at all, if they insisted upon that
        point." "Both parties were firm," the
        report concluded, and the committee disbanded without
        reaching an agreement. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> That afternoon Jay reported to the Convention the
        failure of the informal committee to agree. "No
        plan of conciliation has been formed," he confessed, "and
        no measure taken." Jay laid the blame at the door
        of the Antifederalists for "adhering rigidly to
        the principle of conditional adoption, which was inadmissible
        and absurd." According to the correspondent, "he
        went into a consideration of the nature and tendency
        of such an adoption, compared it with the powers delegated
        to the Convention, as well as to the powers of the
        future Congress, and inferred that [a conditional ratification]
        would amount to a total rejection." He called
        on the opposition repeatedly to answer his arguments.
        The very next morning Jay opened the Convention's business
        by charging "the unfairness of the proceedings
        of the informal Committee," and registering the
        complaint that "when met for mutual discussion
        they had only been insulted by a complete set of propositions
        in a dictatorial manner for their passive acquiescence." </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> That same day, July 11th, Jay moved that the Constitution
        be ratified with such explanatory amendments as were
        deemed useful to be recommended. Jay was reported as
        having spoken "forcibly" and commanded "great
        attention." Chancellor Livingston, Chief Justice
        Morris, and Hamilton spoke in support of the motion,
        with Melancton Smith leading the opposition. One correspondent
        described the speeches of the Federalists as "masterly" and "animated" and
        reported that they "made sensible impressions
        on the minds of such Antifederalist members, who have
        not yet rendered their conceptions entirely callous,
        by pre-conceived prejudice, to the voice of truth--to
        sound and eloquent reasoning." Thus, "the
        great question," as one correspondent noted, was
        the adoption of the Constitution without conditions
        before any decision could be reached on the Lansing
        amendment. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> The debate initiated on July 11th by Jay's motion
        continued for four full days. As this phase of the
        debates was drawing to a close by July 15th, Hamilton
        conceded that his side was willing "to go as far
        as they thought safe, in recommendatory and explanatory
        amendments." He then read a "list of amendments"--some
        thirteen in all--he and his side were prepared to support.
        Jay announced his backing for the Hamilton list. "We
        are endeavouring to agree," he remarked. "Gentlemen,
        see we have brought forth valuable amendments." He
        then suggested that the number of the original list
        of amendments be "pared down" to achieve
        a consensus, indicating that both sides now seemed
        to be in an accommodating mood. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> As the debate drew to a close, Smith moved that the
        Constitution be ratified <em>on condition</em> that
        a <em>second convention</em> be called to consider
        amendments limiting out-of-state activities by the
        militia, restricting the power of Congress to determine
        the time, place, and manner of elections, prohibiting
        federal excises, "ardent spirits excepted," as
        well as the laying of direct taxes by Congress "within
        this state." </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> Jay responded by noting that the issues raised by
        Smith were matters to be decided by the people, not
        by their agents or attorneys. He followed the very
        next day with an eloquent plea for accommodation in
        which he praised some of the proposed amendments as "valuable," while
        urging that the number be pared down to achieve a consensus.
        In one of his longer and more compelling arguments
        delivered the following day, Jay urged the defeat of
        the conditional amendments proposal. He pointed out
        that since Congress had no power to change any part
        of the Constitution, such a conditional ratification
        would have the effect "of necessity" of New
        York's remaining out of the Union. Then he struck a
        characteristic note combining conciliation and caution: </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> We are sent here on a most important occasion [by]
        Our Constituents calmly to consider and wisely to decide
        on the proposition before us. We were sent here to
        serve general Purposes and promote public Good. We
        should reason together; let us reason first and decide
        afterwards. This Constitution is the work of freemen
        who have given to the world the Highest Evidence of
        Patriotism, disinterestedness, wisdom and great Abilities.
        Therefore let us examine Cautiously before we reject. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> Jay then proceeded to point out that ten states had
        already ratified, after having argued the merits at
        length. "It has grown too fast to be pulled up
        by the Roots." Should we remain out of the Union,
        what, he asked would be the internal condition of the
        state of New York? How about the attitude of our neighbor
        states? Meantime, the federal government will be organizing,
        laws will be made, and New York have no hand in either
        activity. Consider the benefits, he reminded his listeners,
        of Congress sitting in New York and of the U.S. treasury
        and mint being located there, of the amount of specie
        which the presence of the federal government will bring
        into the state. Let us remember, he counseled, that "many
        men of virtue" in other states have found amendments
        desirable. "The door is open. Let us agree," he
        urged in his peroration. "<em>We</em> will have
        our Constitution and <em>you</em> will have your Amendments." </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> It was Melancton Smith who on July 17th brought the
        Convention into focus by proposing a resolution supporting
        the ratification of the Constitution under Article
        V, while reserving the right to withdraw within an
        unspecified number of years if the Constitution was
        not amended in a second convention to be called by
        the New York legislature with a circular letter to
        the other states setting forth the reasons for the
        call. After adjourning until the next day, the Convention
        once more went into a committee of the whole. "The
        Party seemed embarrassed, fearful to divide among themselves,
        and yet many of them were very averse to the new plan," Jay
        reported cheerfully to Washington.[<em>Jay to Washington,
        July 17, 1788,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.10601" target="_blank" class="">10601</a>, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.08432" target="_blank" class="">8432</a>]. "It
        is difficult to conjecture what may be done out of
        doors today," Jay added, but a good deal must
        have been accomplished off the floor, and recent scholars,
        reflecting the testimony of Antifederalists, attributed
        the bulk of it to Jay's persuasive voice. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> Jay, with support from Hamilton, closed the debate
        on the Smith motion by reiterating the point that conditional
        ratification amounted to "no ratification." Proposing
        amendments to the Constitution <em>subsequent</em> to
        its ratification was a proposition always acceptable
        to Jay, even though he had contested some of the proposed
        amendments which struck at the heart of the federal
        government's ability to function. Thus, when on July
        22d "the declaratory part of the proposed Bill
        of Rights came up for consideration, both Jay and Hamilton,
        according to a newspaper correspondent, "made
        some objections, if I recollected aright, to the wording
        of the several political maxims, and contended that
        some of them were not expressed with precision and
        accuracy, although they were truths to which they readily
        yielded their assent." As regards the amendment
        earlier proposed curbing a standing army or control
        of the militia by the federal government, Jay argued
        against such curbs as being counter to "the dictates
        of œconomy; for that on such occasions the government,
        contemplating their full and entire direction of the
        militia, would avoid the raising or the increase of
        their standing forces, to the degree that the national
        emergencies might otherwise require; and that the dictates
        of safety were against it. For, as he and Mr. Hamilton,
        I think, both observed, the surest way to force government
        into the necessity of maintaining armies, was by fettering
        their authority over the militia." </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> From the beginning Jay had made it clear that he
        sympathized with those who felt that the Constitution
        might well be improved by amendments which would be
        in order following its adoption and in accordance with
        its own provisions. Thus, in the debates on a Bill
        of Rights, Jay asked why the proponents did not list
        all the unalienable rights but only singled out three,
        and he made a point of opposing extending the exemption
        to bearing arms to conscientious objectors other than
        Quakers. However, four days later, on July 22d, Jay
        seconded Melancton Smith's motion for an amendment
        setting a maximum eight-year term for President. He
        supported this proposition over Hamilton's opposition
        on the ground that the amendment prevented a President
        for running for a third term. Indeed, Jay would soon
        introduce an amendment of his own. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> The Convention was fast approaching its climax. By
        July 23d Jay could write Washington that the Convention
        by a vote of 31 to 29 had adopted the motion of Samuel
        Jones and stricken out the words "on condition," substituting "in
        full confidence." He cautioned nonetheless that
        the opposition planned "to rally their forces" for
        a last stand.[<em>Jay to Washington, July 23, 1788,</em> &nbsp;<a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.12498" target="_blank" class="">12498</a>, <a href="http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/ldpd/app/jay/item?mode=item&amp;key=columbia.jay.05349" target="_blank" class="">5349</a>]
        On July 24th Jay took the floor to express the hope
        that unanimous agreement could be reached for a second
        convention, striking a harmonious note: "We are
        now one people, all pledged for amendments." Toward
        the very end of the ratifying convention, on July 25th,
        Jay himself proposed an amendment barring all except "natural
        born citizens," who were freeholders as well (with
        some specified exceptions) from eligibility as President,
        Vice President, or as members of either house of Congress,
        a restriction even more severe than that which he had
        proposed to Washington in July of 1787. Lansing's effort
        to delete the restriction to freeholders was defeated,
        and Jay's proposed amendment was adopted by a large
        majority, to be included in the final list of recommendatory
        amendments submitted by the Convention. Fortunately
        for the country this proposed amendment, like so many
        of the others recommended at Poughkeepsie, was never
        incorporated into the Constitution, for the nation
        would have been deprived of the contributions of some
        of Congress' most talented members. Finally, during
        the wind-up sessions, Jay indicated a willingness to
        have the Bill of Rights "expressly" reserve
        to the states and the people "all the rights not
        granted in the Constitution," a major concession
        to states'-rights sentiment that finally appeared in
        the 10th Amendment. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> Shortly thereafter a committee comprising Jay, Lansing,
        and Melancton Smith was charged with preparing a Circular
        Letter to the Governors of the other states (28 July
        1788). Jay's principal authorship seems likely since
        we have a copy in his hand in the McKesson Papers,
        and he was far and away the most experienced draftsman
        of the three. The Circular Letter struck that conciliatory
        note that characterized Jay's consistent performance: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="justified12px"> We observe that amendments have been proposed and
          are anxiously desired by several of the states as
          well as by this; and we think it of great Importance
          that effectual means be immediately taken for calling
          a Convention to meet at a Period not far remote....It
          cannot be necessary to observe that no Government,
          however constituted, can operate well, unless it
          possesses the Confidence and good will of the Body
          of the People. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="justified12px"> The letter was agreed to unanimously. But the battle
        was not quite over. The Convention had to vote down
        a new motion by Lansing reserving the right of the
        state to secede if the amendments were not adopted.
        Lansing's motion was defeated by the perilously close
        vote of 31 to 28, and by almost the same slim margin
        of 30 to 27 the Convention ratified the Constitution,
        with Antifederalists, including Gilbert Livingston,
        Melancton Smith, and Samuel Jones switching to the
        Federalist side while seven Antifederalists abstained. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> In sum, it now appears that the objections to the
        Constitution on the part of the majority of the Antifederalists
        were never so deepseated that they could not be resolved
        by compromise short of conditional ratification. The
        sequence of events by which the Union had become a
        fait accompli before New York's final vote weighed
        heavily on the delegates at Poughkeepsie. The prospect
        that New York City might go it alone, isolating the
        rest of the state and costing it substantial revenue,
        along with the city's own concern that it might not
        be chosen as the seat of the new government should
        the state not ratify, seem to have been substantial,
        if intangible, considerations. Above all, however,
        the cause of the Constitution owed most to the fact
        that men of good will remained conciliatory and flexible,
        willing to be persuaded by better arguments. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> In that victory no inconsiderable part was played
        by the universally respected, conciliatory, openminded,
        and persuasive Jay. From the start of the Poughkeepsie
        Convention he had been prepared to consider amendments.
        He proposed one of his own and seconded another, openly
        differing with Hamilton as regards the latter. Furthermore,
        Jay's willingness to accept "some express reservation
        of state rights amounted to a major concession,
        one that would be implemented by Madison's carefully-phrased
        Tenth Amendment. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> Finally, in drafting the Circular Letter calling
        for a second convention, Jay went further in meeting
        the Antifederalist opposition than did any of the Federalist
        leaders present at ratifying conventions in the other
        states. Indeed, while four other state conventions
        had called for amendments, New York alone added to
        its list of recommended amendments a call upon Congress
        for another convention under the procedures set forth
        in Article V of the Constitution. In sum, when a correspondent
        in a Boston newspaper listed Jay among those not showing "blind
        idolatry for the Constitution," he could justifiably
        point to the conciliatory posture Jay had taken at
        Poughkeepsie. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> Jay's Circular Letter proved unwelcome news to James
        Madison, who expressed the fear that it would have "a
        most pestilent tendency." Indubitably, the Circular
        Letter proved a fillip to Antifederalists not only
        in New York, but in Virginia and Pennsylvania as well,
        while definitely encouraging the opposition in holdout
        states like North Carolina and Rhode Island to delay
        ratification. Even in the short run Madison's fears
        of the ill effects of Jay's Circular Letter proved
        unfounded. In Jay's own state, despite the campaign
        launched on 30 October by a group of "Federal
        Republicans" headed by Customs Collector John
        Lamb and including Melancton Smith, sentiment was already
        moving in a contrary direction. A fortnight earlier
        Jay had been able to report to Edward Rutledge that
        the temper of the opposition, once "violent," had "daily
        become more moderate." While the proposal for
        a second convention should, in Jay's judgment "terminate
        all questions on the subject. If immediately carried," he
        observed, "its friends will be satisfied, and
        if convened three years hence, little danger, perhaps
        some good will attend it." </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> The proposal for a second convention was also advanced
        by a Pennsylvania Antifederalist Convention called
        in Harrisburg in September 1788, and by the Virginia
        legislature, but, when the proposition came before
        the House of Representatives in May 1789, Madison swiftly
        responded by systematically pruning and styling the
        various and numerous amendments submitted by the ratifying
        conventions and reduced them in number to a Bill of
        Rights. Their adoption cut the ground from under the
        move for a second convention, although this mode of
        ratification has found its proponents from time to
        time. </p>
      <p class="justified12px"> As for Jay, we know from his own admission that he
        was not displeased that the country did not rush into
        the second convention.[<em>Jay to Washington, September

        Soon to be Chief Justice, he would have a Constitution
        to interpret, and uncertainty and instability were
        the last things that he and his Federalist colleagues
