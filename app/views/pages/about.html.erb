		  <p>The <strong>Digital Library Collections (DLC)</strong> website is a gateway to digital projects and online exhibitions that have been published on the web by <a href="http://library.columbia.edu">Columbia University Libraries / Information Services</a> (CUL/IS). The site includes scans of photographs, posters, objects, manuscripts and other material from our special and archival collections. It will continue to grow as more of our legacy digital content is loaded in, as more of our special collections are digitized and described, and as hybrid and born-digital archival collections are acquired. The DLC website does not at present include scans of our rare or out-of-copyright digitized books or digitized newspapers, however; these and other historical digital content can be located by searching our <a href="http://clio.columbia.edu/">CLIO</a> discovery system. </p>
		<p>It is important to note that many projects with content in the DLC also have separate external Columbia websites where the same content is displayed within a broader or thematic context.  Where this is the case, links are provided in the DLC so that content can be viewed in either context.</p>
		<p>Digital content in the DLC website comes almost exclusively from Columbia University Libraries' distinctive collections, namely:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>
			<a href="http://library.columbia.edu/locations/avery.html">Avery Architectural &amp; Fine Arts Library</a>
		  </li>
		  <li>
			<a href="http://library.columbia.edu/locations/burke.html">Burke Library at Union Theological Seminary</a>
		  </li>
		  <li>
			<a href="http://library.columbia.edu/locations/eastasian.html">C.V. Starr East Asian Library</a>
		  </li>
		  <li>
			<a href="http://library.columbia.edu/locations/rbml.html">Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library</a>
		  </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Columbia University is providing access to these materials for educational and research purposes only.  For instructions about about obtaining reproductions of or republishing the items found in this site, please see the Terms of Use page.</p>
		<p>Note that the term "project" in this site is used to describe a specific online website or digital exhibition created by CUL/IS, such as "Chinese Paper Gods" or "Jewels in Her Crown."  The term "collection" here refers to a named archival or rare book collection – e.g., the "Anne S. Goodrich Collection" or the "Book Arts Collection" -- housed within one of Columbia's special collections units.  The phrase "Digital Library Collections," on the other hand, is an umbrella term that encompasses all of Columbia's special collections' digitized or born-digital content.</p>
