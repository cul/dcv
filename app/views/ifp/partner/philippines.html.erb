The Philippine Social Science Council (PSSC), an associational membership organization, established in 1968, served as the IFP Philippines International Partner. Philippines IFP office selected 222 fellows for Ph. D. and Master-level training. The program in Philippines likely never had an operational website, but had a page at http://www.fordifp.org/philippines/en-us/home.aspx. In 2008, the fellows, who had returned to Philippines after completing their studies, founded the International Fellowships Program-Philippines Alumni Association (IFPPAA). The IFPAA is committed to contributing the Ford Foundationâ€™s goal of social development and justice by conducting research and undertaking socially relevant academic projects.

The materials are in English and Tagalog.
