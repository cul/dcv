The America-Mideast Educational and Training Services (AMIDEAST), Cairo - a leading American non-profit organization engaged in international education, training and development activities in the Middle East and North Africa – was the Ford IFP International Partner in the Middle East, responsible for the programs in Egypt and Palestine. The Palestinian arm of the program initially maintained two local offices for West Bank and Gaza Strip, which later merged into a single office and closed down in Nov 2012. 149 Palestinian men and women have been selected as IFP Fellows. 
The IFP fellows from Palestine have included women activists, village council members, and representatives of charitable organizations, refugee camp committees, and grassroot NGOs. Four out of five IFP fellows received funding for master’s degree programs, the remainder for Ph.D programs, at universities around the world. AMIDEAST also supports the work of Palestine Chapter of the International Fellowships Program Alumni Association (IFPAA).
