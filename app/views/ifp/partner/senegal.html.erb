Senegal, along with Ghana and Nigeria, was among the pilot IFP programs that started in November 2001 and selected its first cohort of fellows in 2001. The Ford Foundation International Fellowships Program in West Africa has been coordinated by the Association of African Universities, with its headquarters in Accra, Ghana. In Senegal, AAU worked in collaboration with the West African Research Center (WARC) and selected 93 fellows from this country. The AAU also coordinates alumni activities in West Africa. Fellows selected from the West Africa went to study in Britain, Canada, France, Switzerland, South Africa, The Netherlands and the United States of America. A few have chosen to study in their home countries such as Ghana and Senegal. AAU is also coordinating the IFP alumni activities in West Africa.
