The America-Mideast Educational and Training Services (AMIDEAST), located in Cairo served as the host institution and the international IFP Partner, running the program in Egypt and Palestine in 2001-2012.  AMIDEAST is a leading American non-profit organization engaged in international education, training and development activities in the Middle East and North Africa. Founded in 1951, AMIDEAST in its early years focused on promoting U.S. study to students in the region and managing U.S. scholarships and exchanges such as the flagship Fulbright Foreign Student Program, but has since significantly expanded its scope of activities. 172 men and women in Egypt have been selected as IFP Fellows since the program began. IFP fellows have included women activists, village council members, and representatives of charitable organizations, and grassroot NGOs. Four out of five IFP fellows received funding for masterâ€™s degree programs, the remainder for Ph.D programs, at universities around the world.

The Egyptian IFP office was closed on June 30, 2013. Digital materials on a hard drive (10.9 GB), as well as 30 l.f. of paper records were delivered in May 2013. A small (0.3 l.f.) addition of paper records arrived in June 2013. The materials in English and Arabic include administrative program files, fellow files, audiovisual materials and archived AMIDEAST website. 102 fellows consented to give researchers access to their files.
