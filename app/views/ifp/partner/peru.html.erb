IFP for the Andean Region and Southern Cone (IFP AR &amp; SC), implemented in Chile and Peru, was among the four pilot IFP programs; it began in November 2000 and formed its first fellow cohort in 2001. The coordination of the program was the responsibility of EQUITAS Foundation, the IFP International Partner that also administered the program in Chile. The Institute of Peruvian Studies (IEP), an autonomous private non-profit organization, founded in 1964 with the mission of developing social science research and training activities, was responsible for implementing the IFP program in Peru. The IFP selected 176 fellows from Peru. The Peruvian IFP alumni are members of the Civil Association: Center for Social Development (CENDES), founded in 2005.
