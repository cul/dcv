<h2 class="lead">About the DCV</h2>
<p>
The Columbia Digital Collections Portal is a gateway to many of the digital projects that Columbia University Libraries / Information Services has completed over the past ten years. It includes scans of photographs, posters, objects, manuscripts and other archival material from our special and archival collections -- the Rare Book and Manuscript Library, the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library, the C.V. Starr East Asian Library, and the Burke Library at Union Theological Seminary. The Portal will continue to grow as more of our special collections are digitized and cataloged. (It does not at present include digitized books, however; these can be located by searching the CLIO catalog.) All Portal content is intended to be used for education and research.
