Description:
    NOTE: THIS GENERATOR IS NOT COMPLETE!  It will not work.
    Generates the required files for a new subsite.  Pass the --restricted option for a restricted subsite.

Example:
    rails generate subsite my_subsite false

    This will create:
        app/controllers/my_subsite_controller.rb
        lib/dcv/configurators/my_subsite_configurator.rb
        app/views/my_subsite/
        app/views/my_subsite/home.html.erb
        
        app/assets/stylesheets/my_subsite.scss
        app/assets/stylesheets/my_subsite/
        app/assets/stylesheets/my_subsite/my_subsite.scss
        app/assets/javascripts/my_subsite.js
        app/assets/javascripts/my_subsite/
        app/assets/javascripts/my_subsite/my_subsite.js
        
        
        app/views/layouts/my_subsite.html.erb
        
        
    After the generator runs, you should add an additional entry to subsites.yml:
    my_subsite:
      layout: 'my_subsite'
      
    And make sure to restart your rails server so that the new routes are automatically picked up.
